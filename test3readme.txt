In this first program a simple summation is being executed of elements of array v.

Start
	Declare your variable v that represents an array of size 3
	Load into the array the numbers 1,2 and 3
	Begin by loading the address of the array and store it in register x9
	Load the first value on register x10 (value is 1)
	Load the second value on register x11 (value is 2)
	Add the value in x10 and x11 and store the result back in x10 (sum is 3)
	Load the third value into register x11 (value is 3, since that is the third number, this is not the sum)
	Add the values in x10 and x11 and store it back into x10(sum is 6)
Done
